## Web Frontend Skeleton

The experimental Tkinter GUI has been replaced by a placeholder web frontend. To view it, serve the `web/` directory with any static file server, e.g.:

```sh
python -m http.server --directory web 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
